Movement is a prototype service for people who want to get involved in grassroots activism but don't know how.

We used off the shelf digital tools like WhatsApp to offer recommended first events. We facilitated conversations between first timers and organisers. Participants were grouped by shared interests or concerns so they could begin to organise themselves.
