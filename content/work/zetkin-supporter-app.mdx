We worked with [Zetkin Foundation](https://zetk.in/) to design their white-label Supporter app. This project began as a joint venture between three Scandinavian left parties: Enhedslisten, Sosialistisk Venstreparti and Vänsterpartiet.  The app provides people with simple ways to get involved with each party in the lead up to their respective elections.

The goal of the project is to make getting involved in activism fun and accessible. Each person is given a few tasks to complete every day. As they complete tasks and demonstrate their commitment, they are given more complex and important tasks to do. We added fun illustrations and features like streaks, celebrations and satisfying user interface interactions, to make engaging with the app feel like playing a game.
