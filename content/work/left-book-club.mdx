The Left Book Club is a non-profit membership organisation founded in 1936 to oppose war, inequality and fascism. Today they support political education, by publishing radical writing and encouraging its members to organise reading groups.

We worked with LBC to replatform them to a modern website, membership and payments stack that fit their subscription model (Wagtail and Stripe) including ongoing technical support.

We also supported them to design and iterate on a community strategy and trained them on meetup facilitation, through weekly coaching calls. As part of these experiments we set up a [Circle.so](https://community.leftbookclub.com) community forum and set up single sign-on for members to their website.
