[StopWatch](https://www.stop-watch.org/) campaigns against the over-policing of marginalised communities, with a primary focus on stop and search. They take a research-based approach to act against injustice, campaign for evidence-based policies, hold the police force to account, and empower marginalised communities.

We designed and developed their new website, which makes it easier for anyone to learn about these issues, access holistic support and share their experiences.
