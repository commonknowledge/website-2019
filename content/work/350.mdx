In early 2022 we conducted a Research and Discovery project for the international climate justice organisation [350.org](https://350.org/).

We investigated how they might migrate their complex digital estate to WordPressâ€™ Gutenberg editor. This involved embedding ourselves within their product team, facilitating stakeholder interviews, reviewing their past progress towards migration, conducting a thorough audit of their sites and trialling our proposed migration approach locally.

At the end of this process, we prepared a report with our recommended approach, breakdown of our proposed phases (including how to approach the internal communications, research, training and development) and an assessment of potential risks and how to mitigate them.
