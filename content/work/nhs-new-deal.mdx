Just Treatment is a patient-led organisation campaigning to ensure everyone has fair access to high quality healthcare.

We worked with them on their new [NHS New Deal](https://www.nhsnewdeal.org/) campaign. The campaign calls for proper funding for our NHS, support for doctors and nurses, and putting the health of patients above the interests of big corporations.

The website offers an entry point for people to get involved in their people-powered campaign. From there, Just Treatment organisers can connect with these people directly, suggest ways for them to take action and put pressure on politicians to meet their demands.
