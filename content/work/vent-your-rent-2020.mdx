We updated the Vent Your Rent site to support [Generation Rent's](https://www.generationrent.org/) campaign to protect renters affected by coronavirus.

The new version of site asks renters to share details about their rental situation, in order to build an evidence base, raise the public profile of renters' issues and lobby policy-makers.

We plotted these stories on a map, to assure renters that they were not alone and that others near them were also struggling.
