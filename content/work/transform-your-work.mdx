We worked with the think tank [Autonomy](https://autonomy.work/) to create a toolkit of workerâ€™s inquiries. 

Transform your Work is a collection of approaches, step-by-step guides and historical examples of worker organising. People can use these tools to understand the power dynamics of their own workplaces, in order to start organising to change them.

Supported by the [Barry Amiel and Norman Melburn Trust](https://amielandmelburn.org.uk/).
