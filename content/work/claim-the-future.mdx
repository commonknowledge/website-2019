We designed and developed the website and identity forÂ [Claim the Future](http://claimthefuture.today/), a project initiated by John McDonnell MP.

Claim the Future aims to respond to the economic and political upheaval caused by the pandemic by uniting the left behind a radical and optimistic vision of the future. The project links strategy with campaigning and action on the ground, bringing together a broad range of political actors to start imagining and building the future together.
