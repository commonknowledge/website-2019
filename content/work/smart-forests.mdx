We worked with the [Smart Forests](https://smartforests.net/) researchers from the University of Cambridge to create a living archive and virtual field site exploring how digital technologies are transforming forests.

The Atlas consists of four wayfinding devices: Logbooks, Map, Radio and Stories. This layered interface is designed to weave together a broad range of content from interviews to sensor data, soundscapes, and images. The Atlas platform provides tools for researchers, stakeholders and publics to gather, explore, analyse, annotate, reflect on and reimagine smart forest knowledges and technologies.

Launching in October 2022.
