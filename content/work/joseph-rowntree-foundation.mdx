The mission of the [Joseph Rowntree Foundation](https://www.jrf.org.uk/) is to *inspire action and change to solve UK poverty*. At the moment, they do a mix of traditional think tank work, supporting cultural and third sector initiatives, co-designing policies with people with lived experience of poverty, online campaigning, supporting grassroots organisations, and working in coalition with other charities and foundations.

We collaborated with them to explore what roles they might play within this movement ecosystem. Our goal was to find new ways to surface their work online, through a research and rapid prototyping. These prototypes explored how to directly link research and policy recommendations to campaigning and building power in communities affected by poverty.
