Over the past few years, weâ€™ve worked in collaboration with [Zetkin Foundation](https://zetk.in/) on their platform for organising activism. Building upon the research we did in 2020 with [United Voices of the World](https://www.uvwunion.org.uk/en/), we helped them with the user experience and interface design of a new feature called Journeys.

This feature enables organisers to track their members through different pathways, such as casework or onboarding. Once an organiser starts a member on a Journey, they can collaborate with the rest of their organisation to add notes, emails and other attachments, complete milestones and add tags.

The new generation app is currently being tested with a select group of users. [Get in touch](https://zetkin.org/en/contact) with Zetkin if you're interested in a demo.
