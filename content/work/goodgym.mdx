GoodGym is a network of people across the UK who get fit by doing good. They are an accessible and welcoming community that helps people get involved with volunteering in their local area.

We worked with them to reflect upon and deepen their membership offering. This included user research, stakeholder interviews, usability testing and strategic consultancy. We continue to work as an embedded product team within their organisation, helping them improve the user experience and interface design of their app.
