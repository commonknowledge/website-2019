Airsift is part of a larger research project called [Citizen Sense](https://citizensense.net/), which investigates the relationship between technologies and practices of environmental sensing and citizen engagement.

We worked with them to develop the new [Airsift](http://airsift.citizensense.net/) platform, which allows local groups to document their observations, analyse data from air quality monitors, and collect these into data stories.
