The [Game Worker Solidarity Project](https://gameworkersolidarity.com/) maps and documents collective movements by game workers striving to improve their working conditions. 

The site is a living resource full of tactics, materials and ideas, plotted geographically and chronologically. You can search the archive by location, type of action, company or union. Anyone can [submit](https://gameworkersolidarity.com/submit) an action to the archive, access the [full dataset](https://gameworkersolidarity.com/data) or [contribute](https://github.com/gameworkersolidarity/website) to the project.
