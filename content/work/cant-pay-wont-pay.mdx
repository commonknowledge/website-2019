We worked with London Renters Union on their [Can’t Pay Won’t Pay](https://londonrentersunion.org/cantpaywontpay/) campaign.

This campaign focussed on building renter power during the pandemic, identifying and providing support to those at risk of eviction, and lobbying local and national government to cancel rent debt and ban Section 21 evictions permanently.

Working within their existing technical architecture, we built two iterations of a custom tool that allowed people to join the campaign, understand their legal rights, find advice and resources to help them and read stories from other renters.
