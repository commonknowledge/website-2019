[United Voices of the World](https://www.uvwunion.org.uk/) is a grassroots trade union of low paid, migrant and precarious workers.

Since May 2020, we worked with them to establish a new digital system for their casework. The goal was to help improve their working processes and assist them in scaling up their operations. 

We also helped migrate them to [Zetkin](http://zetk.in/), a platform for activism and relational organising.

Supported by the [Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung](https://www.rosalux.de/en/).
