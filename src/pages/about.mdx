# We are a not-for-profit worker cooperative building digital tools for grassroots organisers.

Our team shares a vision of an abundant democratic culture in which people are confident in their capacity to self-organise.

Our aim is to empower people to directly resist all forms of oppression, form more resilient and autonomous communities, and organise themselves at ever larger scales.

## How we work

We place a strong focus on building trust and shared understanding with the organisers we work with. We listen to their needs, work out we could augment their organisational capacity and directly co-design tools in collaboration with them.

We work in agile sprints: short bursts of focused activity where we follow a build-measure-learn cycle. This enables us to iterate quickly and efficiently, ensuring that we meet real needs without wasting resources on unnecessary features.
