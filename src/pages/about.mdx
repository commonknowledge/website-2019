## Our values

### Solidarity

We act in solidarity with those who are struggling against all forms of oppression. Solidarity is power. Diversity is strength.

### Interdependence

We cultivate reciprocal relationships where we can practice collaboration and generosity, not competition and scarcity. We see the commons as our opportunity to have the biggest impact.

### Thoughtfulness

We understand and respect the complexity of political and technological structures. We trust people to know their own context best. We think before intervening and intervene at the appropriate scale. We listen deeply and reflect with intention. 

### Practice

We believe learning is an endless journey. We use theory and practice to intensify each other. We are curious, creative and interdisciplinary. We ask questions and lean into change.

### Optimism

We approach problems as challenges and see failures as opportunities to grow. We remember the capacity of people to collectively build a better future. We trust that people can.

## How we work

We place a strong focus on building trust and shared understanding with the organisers we work with. We listen to their needs, work out we could support and amplify their work, and design tools in direct collaboration with them.

We work in agile sprints: short bursts of focused activity where we follow a build-measure-learn cycle. This enables us to iterate quickly and efficiently, ensuring that we meet real needs without wasting resources on unnecessary features.
